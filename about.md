### Hi, I'm Spencer, and I'm an overthinker. 

Ever hear, "I think you're overthinking this"? It's something I hear a lot. It often gets me into trouble.. with myself.. as I take unlikely scenarios and make them even more unlikely. Without fail. Time and time again.

Maybe it's paranoia or some other anxiety disorder? Perhaps it's just a vibrant imagination? A driving force for creativity and knowledge seeking? Whatever it is, it's been a source of anxiety for me for as long as I can remember.

But.. it can also be a kind of super power.

I have a habit of obsessing over ideas, at least ones that interest me. Even to the point where I start losing sleep over it. It can be madddening, but also rewarding. The prize at the end - a greater understanding of whatever it is that is vexing me - makes it all worth it. It's just that the path there is often messy and zig-zaggy.

Where I think it becomes a super power is when it's something useful to my career or every day life, rather than just trivia night. As a software developer, my fascination with software design and architecture has been a huge benefit to my career. It's allowed me to carve out a bit of a niche as a specialist of some kind, although I'm still not completely certain what that is.

Acting as a sidecar to all of the overthinking has been chronic doubt. Something I've noticed throughout my life is how confident other people appear to be in their knowledge. For a long time it always made me feel kind of dumb - how can everyone be so sure about the things they know when I've spent so much time thinking about the same thing and feel I know less than when I started? It could be that most people are just more comfortable with working knowledge than I am. It could also just be that I'm a slow learner, or maybe it's a case of imposter syndrome.

So why the blog?

For a long time I've internalized a lot of my thoughts, sharing many of them only with certain people. I'm hoping this blog will give me another outlet for those thoughts (at least the ones that I think are worth letting out). It will also give me a new means to explore and refine the ideas floating around in my head, even if no one is actually reading, as I try to articulate what it is I'm thinking. Maybe, it will even make me a better writer.

Posts will likely be infrequent and not on any kind of schedule. I doubt there will be any overall theme, just whatever it is I'm thinking about at the time that I think is worth writing about. Hopefully the content will be interesting to someone, maybe even sometimes novel, but if not, at least it'll be another home for my thoughts.
